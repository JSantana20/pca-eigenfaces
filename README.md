# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains a series of projects I have developed in the areas of supervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Projects like the SVD image compression algorithm and the CNN for glaucoma diagnosis are still in development, meaning there are particular improvments or applications I want to implement with them in the near future.
