# CNN architecture for glaucoma diagnosis
This project's goal is, initially, to create a training tool for medical students that are interested in studying these eye conditions. A CNN architecture was
proposed and train using the RIM-ONE DL database.
As the database is composed by a rather reduced number of samples, data augmentation is thought as the next step towards the generalization of the model.
