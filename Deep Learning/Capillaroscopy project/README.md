# Capillaroscopy analysis for rheumatological diseases detection using U-Nets
This project is part of the Innovation in Healthcare research group affiliated to the Faculty of Medicine at the National University of Colombia. Its goal is to develop
an automated tool to help the specialist identify critical features that may suggest the presence of a rheumatological disease in a patient. The aforementioned procedure
is done manually at the moment and only by specially trained medical personnel. 
As a first step towards the development of this tool, the team plans for it to function as a pedagogical tool for medicine students.
Going to a more technical field, the U-Net architecture is being implemented for the segmentation of capillaroscopy samples in order to obtain a binarized image that
could provide key information about the presence of features such as tortuosities or avascular zones.
