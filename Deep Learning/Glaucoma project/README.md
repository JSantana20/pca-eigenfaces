# CNN architecture for glaucoma diagnosis
This project's goal is, initially, to create a training tool for medicine students that are interested in these eye conditions. A CNN architecture was
proposed and train using the RIM-ONE DL database.
As the database is composed by a rather reduced number of samples, data augmentation is thought as the next step towards the generalization of the model. Additionally, a transfer learning approach is being developed to enhance test accuracy (appropriate validated model needs to be found). Finally, a probabilistic model would be the next step to follow after the aforementioned improvements, by means of TensorFlow's probability library.
